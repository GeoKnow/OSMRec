model files: 
these files are created by training an svm model given an input file.
If no conf parameter "-c" is given from user, 
several test models are produced and the program chooses the optimal model and conf parameter for the recommendation phase.

.mat.kclusters files:
these files are the output of the clustering process. The .kClusters is the number of clusters produced based on the average instance per cluster
provided by the user with -k parameter.
